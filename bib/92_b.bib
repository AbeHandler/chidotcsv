communication is frequent, interactive, and expressive. Informal communication is
crucial for the coordination of work, learning an organization's culture, the perpetuation
of the social relations that underlie collaboration, and, in general, any situation
that requires communication to resolve ambiguity. Informal communication is traditionally
mediated by physical proximity, but physical proximity cannot mediate in geographically
distributed organizations. The research described here evaluates the adequacy of a
version of a desktop video/audio conferencing system for supporting informal communication
in a research and development laboratory. The evaluation took place during a trial
in which the  system was used by summer employees and their supervisor-mentors. While
the system was used frequently, the most common uses and users' assessments suggest
that it was used more like a telephone or electronic mail than like physically mediated
face-to-face communication. However, some features of its use transcended traditional
media and allowed users to gain awareness of their work environment. The paper concludes
with a discussion of requirements for successful technology to support informal communication.},

students to improve their spatial reasoning and 3D visualization skills is described.

those skills that engineers use to reason about 3D objects based on 2D representations.
The software uses an intuitive and interactive interface allowing direct manipulation
of objects. Animation capability is provided to demonstrate the relationship between
arbitrary positions of an object and standard orthographic views. A second skill of
interest requires visualization of a cutting-plane intersection of an object. An interface
is developed which allows intuitive positioning of the cutting-plane utilizing the
metaphor of a “pool of water” in which the object is partially submerged. The surface
of the water represents the cutting plane. Adjustment of the pool depth combined with
direct manipulation of the object provides for arbitrary positioning of the cutting-plane.
Subjective evaluation of the software thus far indicates that students enjoy using
it and find it helpful. A formal testing plan to objectively evaluate the software
and interface design is underway.},

special challenges in the design of user interfaces. The challenge is particularly
difficult when automation is intermittent because the interface must support smooth

that this interface style will smooth the transition. Interfaces were designed to
test the prediction and to evaluate two aspects of direct manipulation, semantic distance
and engagement. Empirical results supported the theoretical prediction and also showed
that direct engagement can have some adverse effects on another concurrent manual
task. Generalizations of our results to other complex systems are presented.},

often exhibit procedural dependences; that these dependences are mainly due to external
task; and that they can be exploited for inferring the users' goals and plans. While
there is a clear need for task models in IR to account for situational determinants
of user behaviour, what is required are hybrid models that take account of both is
“planned” and “situated” aspects. Empirical evidence for the points made is reported
from a probabilistic analysis of retrieval sessions with a fact database and from
experience with plan-based and state-based methods for user support in an experimental

50% during the implementation phase, and 37% during the maintenance phase. 34% of
the systems were implemented using a toolkit, 27% used a UIMS, 14% used an interface

more sophisticated user interfaces. The projects using UIMSs or interface builders
spent the least percent of time and code on the user interface (around 41%) suggesting
that these tools are effective. In general, people were happy with the tools they
used, especially the graphical interface builders. The most common problems people
reported when developing a user interface included getting users' requirements, writing
help text, achieving consistency, learning how to use the tools, getting acceptable
performance, and communicating among various parts of the program.},

The conclusion is that orientation, size (1/spatial frequency), and contrast (amplitude)

parameters will be subject to similar distortions to those found when color is used.
Textures synthesized using Gabor function primitives can be modulated along the three
primary dimensions. Some preliminary results from a study using Gabor functions to
modulate luminance are presented which suggest that: perceived texture size difference
are approximately logarithmic, a 5% change in texton size is detectable 50% of the
time, and large perceived size differences do not predict small (just noticeable)
size differences.},

the conditions for automaticity are often radically changed. In most cases the reader
has to gain the corresponding knowledge by effortful cognitive processes. This means
adding to the cognitive load leaving less attentional capacity for the main task at
hand. This problem can be avoided by a careful analysis of a reading task into its
automatic and non-automatic components, followed by a dedicated user interface design

connectimg them to application semantics. This approach has four problems. First,
most widgets are too low-level; constructing interfaces from them takes too much work.
Second, working with widgets focuses attention on appearance and layout issues, rather
than on more important semantic design issues. Third, designers can easily make poor
widget choices, yielding poor interfaces. Fourth, widgets do not mesh well with application
semantics; they know nothing about the variables they control. We are developing an
application construction environment in which designers and implementers work with
semantic-based controls called Selectors rather than with widgets. Selectors are classified
according to their interface semantics (e.g., mutually-exclusive choice), rather than
their appearance. Each type of Selector can be presented in a variety of ways; this
may be chosen semi-automatically. Selectors mesh well with application semantics:
their values are application data-types and their views determine how to present valid
values automatically.},

two factors: (1) the effort required to synchronize input system availability and
(2) the accuracy level afforded. Results indicate that users, seeking to minimize
effort and maximize accuracy, choose among three strategies – automatic performance,
pacing, and monitoring. These findings provide a systematic account of the influence
of system delay on user performance, based on adaptive strategy choice drive by cost.},

multiple users from multiple workstations, simultaneously. This goal caused us to
choose an architecture that requires a clean run-time separation of user interfaces
from applications. Such a separation  has long been state goal of UIMS researchers,
but it is difficult to achieve. A key technical reason for the difficulty is that
modern direct manipulation interfaces require extensive communication between the
user interface and the application to provide semantic feedback. We discuss several
communications mechanisms that have been used in the past, and present our approach
— the Abstraction-Link-View paradigm. Links are objects whose sole responsibility
is to facilitate communication between the abstraction objects (application) and the
view objects (user interfaces). The Abstraction-Link-View paradigm relies on concurrency
and a fast but powerful constraint system.},
